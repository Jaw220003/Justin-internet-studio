<h1>Favorite Movies</h1>
<p>These movies that are listed are known be my favorites as to liking a mixure of action pack, comedy, little bit of drama, and cartoons that express who I am today. Many people might not get the references or never seen the movies I watched growing up, but I treasure these as the way of enjoying the outside world.</p>
