		<br>and the technical markup to convey that meaning to browsers, assistive technologies, and search engines.</li>
	  </ul>

		<li>Enhance accessibility for users with disabilities and assistive technologies, improve SEO for search engine understanding
		<br>and indexing, provide better user experience by clearly defining content hierarchy, and make the code itself more readable 
		<br>and maintainable for developers.</li>
