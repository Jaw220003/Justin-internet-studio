    <h1>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML</h1>
	  <ul>
		<li>Structred content resulted in ambiguous or poorly organized code. Semantic HTML5 Elements, on the other hand, 
		<br>introduces a range of specific elements designed to express the semantic meaning of different parts of a webpage</li>
	  </ul>
	<h2>How do they work together?</h2>
	  <ul>
		<li>Structured content and semantic HTML work together by providing both a meaningful organization of information
		<br>and the technical markup to convey that meaning to browsers, assistive technologies, and search engines.</li>
	  </ul>
	<h3>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</h3>
	  <ul>
		<li>Enhance accessibility for users with disabilities and assistive technologies, improve SEO for search engine understanding
		<br>and indexing, provide better user experience by clearly defining content hierarchy, and make the code itself more readable 
		<br>and maintainable for developers.</li>
	  </ul>

	<h6>Banishing Your Inner Critic – Denise Jacobs</h6>
  <p>
    Denise Jacobs compares our self-doubt to a troll-like “inner critic” that hinders creativity and productivity. Of the techniques she offers to silence this critic, the most successful one for me would be <strong>“naming and externalizing the inner critic.”</strong> By giving it a separate identity, I can detach those negative thoughts from myself and view them more objectively. This would help me stop internalizing self-doubt and allow me to move forward with confidence in my creative work.

  <h7>Procrastination – David McRaney</h7>
  <p>
    In the YouTube video, David McRaney explains the concept of <strong>“hyperbolic discounting”</strong> — the tendency to choose smaller, immediate rewards over larger, delayed rewards. This explains why we often procrastinate, favoring short-term comfort over long-term success. One method McRaney identifies to counteract this is <strong>“precommitment”</strong>, where you make a decision in advance that locks in your future behavior (like using a website blocker or setting a deadline with consequences). This would work best for me because creating structure and accountability ahead of time helps me avoid temptation and stay focused.

  <h8>Critical Web Design – Chapter 1: Networks</h8>
  <p>
    The chapter outlines four types of power in networks: <strong>power over, power to, power with, and power within.</strong> As a beginner in web publishing, I have some <strong>“power to”</strong> — the ability to create and publish my own content online. This gives me agency in shaping how my voice is represented on the web. However, my influence (or “power over”) a broader audience or system is currently limited. As I learn more and connect with others, I hope to gain more “power with” and “power within” through collaboration and confidence in my own digital identity.
