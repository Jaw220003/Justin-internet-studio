	<h2> The Domain Name You Like Best and Why</h2>
	<p>When coming up with the names of my project with my classmate, I wanted to sound genuate with my name. For it to flow to and have a meaningful name to for my audience is coming up with something that matches the tone for everyone's pleasing. Though some names whree good yet the expenses were high for monthly payment, altering it was the other option that would match with my project.</p>
	<p>The name the I chose for my project will be "worthies.org", it sounds more genuie and hope for people that are passionite with photography and want to understand camera usage.</p>
