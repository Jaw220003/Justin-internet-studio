	<h1>Michael Jackson</h1>
	<p>Song writer and Dancer</p>
	<p>Michael Joseph Jackson, known as the “King of Pop”, was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist who influenced pop culture globally.
	<br>His music and signature dance moves, like the moonwalk, broke down racial and social barriers. Jackson's influence extended beyond singing and songwriting to revolutionize music production, video presentation, concert touring, and dance.</p>

	<li>From the Better User Experience Through Storytelling Articles: The way my semseter project in a story format will help refine my ideas is by encouraging you to see the experience through the user’s eyes. By telling the story of someone using a camera
		<br>from the decision to capture a moment to sharing or saving the photos you've begin to understand their goals, emotions, and pain points. This approach highlights what features truly matter, where users might struggle, and what makes the experience enjoyable. 
		<br>Rather than focusing only on technical details, storytelling helps you create a more thoughtful, user-centered design that’s guided by real needs and meaningful moments.</li>
