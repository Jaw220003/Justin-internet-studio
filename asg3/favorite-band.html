	<h1>Michael Jackson</h1>
	<p>Song writer and Dancer</p>
	<p>Michael Joseph Jackson, known as the “King of Pop”, was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist who influenced pop culture globally.
	<br>His music and signature dance moves, like the moonwalk, broke down racial and social barriers. Jackson's influence extended beyond singing and songwriting to revolutionize music production, video presentation, concert touring, and dance.</p>
