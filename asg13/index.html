          <p>I believe this would a great entrance level job, because it gets me used to working with the technology and gives me room to better my skills in customer service. I personally love putting up and taking down gear, which is essentially half of this job. It will be small scale which is excellent for a starter job and decently low stakes as it's no stadium. In a hotel, they usually have a designated audio system, so I will probably be using consistent gear and get more familiar with it, which is also beneficial.</p>
