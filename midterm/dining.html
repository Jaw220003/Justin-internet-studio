<h1>Places To Eat</h1>

	<h2>Krusty Krab</h2>
	<p>The Krusty Krab is a fictional fast-food restaurant in the animated show SpongeBob SquarePants, 
	<br>owned by the greedy Eugene H. Krabs, which serves the popular Krabby Patty. 
	<br>The restaurant is known for its rivalry with the Chum Bucket, owned by Plankton, 
	<br>who constantly tries to steal the secret formula for the Krabby Patty. SpongeBob works as the fry cook, while Squidward is the cashier, 
	<br>and the building is shaped like a lobster trap.</p>

	<h2>Weenie Hut Juniors</h2>

	<p>Weenie Hut Jr.'s is a restaurant in SpongeBob SquarePants that is a safe and "soft" alternative to the tough establishment, Salty Spitoon. It serves as a hangout for characters deemed "weenies," 
	<br>weak, or nerdy, and is known for its weenie-themed menu, robot servers, and various special days. The restaurant's name implies it's for children, but it also serves as a place for those considered weak or not tough enough for the Salty Spitoon. </p>

	<h2>Fancy!</h2>

	<p>"Fancy!" can refer to several things in SpongeBob SquarePants, most commonly the high-class restaurant where characters go for expensive meals. It can also refer to the general idea of opulence and high society,
	<br>particularly as represented by the rival character Squilliam Fancyson, who lives a life of luxury. The term is used to describe an environment of wealth and exclusivity, contrasting with the usual, more common settings like the Krusty Krab.</p>
