	<h2>Krusty Krab</h2>
	<p>The Krusty Krab is a fictional fast-food restaurant in the animated show SpongeBob SquarePants, 
	<br>owned by the greedy Eugene H. Krabs, which serves the popular Krabby Patty. 
	<br>The restaurant is known for its rivalry with the Chum Bucket, owned by Plankton, who constantly tries to steal the secret formula for the Krabby Patty. SpongeBob works as the fry cook, while Squidward is the cashier, 
	<br>and the building is shaped like a lobster trap.</p>
