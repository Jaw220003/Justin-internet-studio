	<p>The design statement for Bikini Bottom in SpongeBob SquarePants is rooted in creator Stephen Hillenburg's background in marine biology and is best described as a whimsical, "found-object" aesthetic that blends elements of a typical American city with quirky, aquatic-themed architecture and vibrant, unrealistic colors. The reason I chose this theme for my project was a nostalgic feeling that I always wanted to know what was like to live in the underwater place. I wanted to make it colorful and have joyness scheme. The text placement is set into the center in a border color a Spongebob yellow color and a border line of Patrick pink color, and the size to be normal size to easily read. The color palette are mostly from Spongebob characters from the tv show, such as yellow, pink, red, blue. Images are from Spongebob episode to match up the sections, even the background image of the bubble transitions to match up the project theme. The button styles have a highlight animation and the color pallete of Mr.Krabs. As for button placement to be shown at the bottom footer for contact information, and for menu navigation on top of the screen. The images where to match the humor and scene from the Spongebob episodes that happen in the Bikini Bottom.</p>
