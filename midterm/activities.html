	<h2>Jellyfish Fields</h2>
	<p>Jellyfish Fields is a vast, rolling-pasture area outside Bikini Bottom where millions of jellyfish live and where SpongeBob and Patrick go jellyfishing. It is characterized by its open fields, lily pads, and various locations, including a mountain and caves, and is considered a vital ecosystem within the show's world. The location is a popular destination for the characters to catch jellyfish for their jelly, a process often depicted as peaceful but also shown to be harmful if too much jelly is extracted</p>
