	<h2><span style="color: #ffffff">White Hat</span></h2>
		<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>During the conversation, participants focused on gathering and reviewing the known facts. They compiled available data, identified missing information, and discussed relevant research or reports. No opinions or emotions were introduced, and just objective insights.</p>
		<h3>Response</h3>
			<p>My way of knowing the white hat is by drawing the simple information and direction into understand what steps to use for work with a DSLR camera to beginner and/or professional photographers.</p>

	<h2><span style="color: #b50000">Red Hat</span></h2>
		<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>Emotions and gut reactions came to the surface as team members expressed their instincts and personal feelings about the idea. Some shared excitement and optimism about the potential of the project, while others admitted to feeling uncertain or uneasy due to past failures or current pressures.</p>
		<h3>Response</h3>
			<p>I want to have make my project feel like a easy going process and give people a comfortable feeling when looking over in what ways can they use their camera without being overwhelmed.</p>

	<h2><span style="color: #000000">Black Hat</span></h2>
		<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>The conversation under the Black Hat was cautious and critical, with a focus on potential problems, risks, and obstacles. Participants discussed what could go wrong if certain assumptions failed or if timelines slipped.</p>
		<h3>Response</h3>
			<p>What some downsides that it might occur to my project is showing a speific type of brand for the camera, rather than the various types and brand that is shown for every step depending on the camera holder in which brand they have own.</p>

	<h2><span style="color: #e7d400">Yellow Hat</span></h2>

			<p>With the Yellow Hat, the tone shifted to a more positive outlook. The team explored the potential benefits of moving forward with the proposal, imagining best-case scenarios. They highlighted how the idea could improve efficiency, boost revenue, or solve a longstanding customer problem.</p>

	<h2><span style="color: #00871d">Green Hat</span></h2>
		<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>Creative energy flowed during the Green Hat phase, where participants brainstormed alternatives, new strategies, and unconventional approaches. They looked beyond the original idea, considering how it could be improved or approached from different angles. No suggestion was too wild or impractical during this stage. This led to some breakthrough thinking, including a hybrid solution that combined elements of two competing ideas. The group felt energized by the possibility of innovation and progress.</p>
		<h3>Response</h3>
			<p></p>

	<h2><span style="color: #0009bf">Blue Hat</span></h2>
		<h3>Thoughts</h3>
			<p>Under the Blue Hat, the group took a step back to review the entire discussion. They assessed how each hat had contributed to their understanding and mapped out a clear process moving forward. The facilitator summarized key insights from each perspective, acknowledged unresolved issues, and assigned action items. There was also a discussion about how to revisit the topic once new data became available. The Blue Hat provided structure, closure, and a plan for next steps, ensuring the conversation remained focused and productive.</p>
